    "description": "Hello fellow visitor! I hope you are having fun browsing my site.\nMy name is Igor, professionally I'm an architect. Creating and designing things was always part of my life.\nMy programming career started when I decided to make my own architectural portfolio. I enjoyed creating one so much that I actually grew true passion for coding. Since then I am improving my skills everyday. Getting to know new technologies is a challenge that gives me a lot of satisfaction.\nCurrently I am trying to master pure JavaScript and React framework. I feel confident about designing UI of my applications and styling components in CSS. I'm excited about diving into back-end territory someday, since I had some adventures with python too. I am self-taught, I mainly draw knowledge from creating projects and solving encountered problems. I also read documentation, elementary knowledge of programming language helps in conscious writing of code. I believe that working in a more experienced team will allow me to spread my wings and will grant me a chance to prove that I could be a valuable asset in your company.",
